A simple, extendable template for software engineers to build a blog & portfolio

## Technology
The template is built using Next.js, Contentlayer, and MDX. 
For those unaware of MDX: MDX is a superset of Markdown, essentially it is Markdown + JSX.
This makes it very powerful for developing content for a blog or portfolio.

## Features
- Blogging by adding/editing MDX files in the /content/blog directory. 
- Adding project to your portfolio by adding/editing MDX files in the /content/projects directory. 
- Link social medias using the SocialMediaLink component: Twitter and GitHub are defaults.

## Installation
	1. Clone the repository
	2. Install dependencies via running "npm install" in the directory.
	3. Run the repository locally using "npm run dev", access it via localhost:3000
	4. Customize it as you like =)
