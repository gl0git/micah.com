Note: I will push this repository to GitHub soon, however, it may not include the code (which will be made available on request), 
as this project was made for CS241, and my university disallows sharing project code publicly on the internet.

#### Motivation

The motivation here was to use the MIPS token lexeme DFA (deterministic finite automata) to develop 
a scanner for the MIPS assembly language.

#### Requirements

Making a scanner for the MIPS assembly language required
    1. Representing DFAs (deterministic finite automata) in code
    2. Implementing a greedy algorithm to accept the longest valid lexemes
    3. Using the MIPS token lexeme DFA to recognize lexeme kind to handle lexemes appropriately

#### Strategy

    1. DFAs needed to be represented in code, so the first step was developing a class to represent DFAs. Included
    in this component was using a syntax for consuming DFAs (which was as follows):
        - .STATES followed by a list of states, where a state ending with ! means it is an accepting state
        - .TRANSITIONS followed by a list of transitions, of the format (fromState [characters] toState)
    2. Next, the greedy algorithm of choice for accepting longest valid lexemes was a simplified maximal munch algorithm. The steps of
    implementing this were as follows:
        - Create a getNextState function in the DFA class, which requires an input character and a current state
        - Implement the maximal munch algorithm using the getNextState function to know when to backtrack, etc.
    3. Create I/O that uses the MIPS token lexeme DFA, with principles as follows:
        1. If a lexeme is found, determine a kind using the state or the lexeme itself
        2. If the kind should be filtered, discard the token (which stores lexeme and kind)
        3. If the kind has restrictions, halt and produce an error if they are violated
        4. If 2-3 are false, store the token lexeme and kind, add it to a sequence of tokens to be returned

#### Results

The program definitely works for simple MIPS programs, but has not been tested on larger, more comprehensive programs. I have now learnt
a great amount about DFAs, maximal munch, and scanning languages.
