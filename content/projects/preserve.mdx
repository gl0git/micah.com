description: 'A universal search component for SaaS products'
technologies: 'TypeScript, Next.js/React.js, Supabase/PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS'

Note: This project isn't published yet (still have to buy a domain, publish to NPM, etc.)

#### Motivation

SaaS products are normally hard to use and require user-education, reading documentation, etc. Search is more efficient, be it for commands, or 
using "Ask AI" features using embeddings & context injection.

#### Features
    - An importable React.js/Next.js component, \<Search />
    - Ability to add any code or no-code command to the component
    - Abstractions for common uses to simplify the development process
    - "Ask AI" feature trained on repository-specific documentation
    - More smaller features (listing them all would be too long for this post)

#### Issues/Solutions (Format: Issue => Solution)
    - End-users will make typos/errors => make search fuzzy.
    - End-users may be abroad, leading to high latency => use Edge Functions.
    - Fetching data on page-load is inefficient (repetitive), unnecessary => Fetch data on app-load instead, and share data with components using a ContextProvider

#### Results

The component is built. I just have to register a domain, deploy Clerk, publish the related package to NPM, etc. It's looking great and I am excited to launch.
