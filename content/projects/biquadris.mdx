#### Motivation

This project was a final project for a course on object-oriented programming at my university (UWaterloo). So naturally, the goal here was to 
use object-oriented programming skills and C++ patterns to build something complete and fun to play.

#### Requirements

To build the project, I had to implement all features of Tetris, while accomodating for additional features involved in making it multiplayer.
In addition, the project specifications required a solid design that considered:
    1. Making modifications with minimal re-compilation
    2. Attaining high cohesion and low coupling

#### Strategy

    1. This is a large project, where design is particularly important: so I laid out a design first. This design was flexible, and could be changed, 
    but laid out a general idea of how I would implement it. I wrote up a UML diagram of the classes and their relations. 
    2. The game needed to be testable. That meant implementing the drawing of the game board and the tile slots,
    so I could monitor them when developing the game. This was done next.
    3. Implementing game logic and the CLI commands for interacting with the game came next, and rounded off the project.

#### Results

The game was completed, with the game's design earning 100%. The project repository is posted at the top of the page, go check it out!
