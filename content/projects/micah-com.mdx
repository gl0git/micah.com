#### Motivation

The motivation here was to build a personal website for myself, but in the process, build a simple, extendable template and content-management system
for other software engineers to build the same. I used Lee Rob's (VP DevRel @ Vercel) portfolio template as heavy inspiration for this.

#### Features

The initial set of features is as follows:
    - Blogging using Contentlayer + MDX to post blogs by simply editing files
    - Project sharing using Contentlayer + MDX for a clean pipeline for uploading 
    - Social media linking, SPA navigation, simple animation

#### Implementation

I built the project using Next.js, Contentlayer, and TailwindCSS. 
1. Next.js for simple SPA routing, server-rendering website content, and ease of use
2. Contentlayer for developing content-management systems for blogs & projects
3. TailwindCSS to whip up styling quickly, and because I'm most used to it

#### Results

I think it turned out nicely. What do you think? Go check out the repository at the top!
