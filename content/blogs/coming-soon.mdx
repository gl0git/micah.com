summary: An explanation of what this blog is about
---

One of my inspirations, both as a programmer and a writer, is Aaron Swartz; Aaron, who is now unfortunately deceased, had a web log called Raw Thought. 
In that web log, he wrote his unfiltered thinking and learnings throughout his life: some of those stories and learnings have inspired and helped me greatly.

This blog is not about software engineering, nor is it about any one particular matter; the subject of this blog will fluctuate throughout my life, as I 
explore new things, come to new learnings, and develop as a person. This blog is about my learnings and development in life.

I hope to use this blog as an exercise to improve my writing and thinking abilities, and to document my progression as I develop in life.
Fundamentally, this blog is for me. However, I still hope you enjoy it; and I hope some of my thoughts help someone who reads this.
