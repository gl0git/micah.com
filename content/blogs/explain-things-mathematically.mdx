summary: How mathematical explanations can improve communication
---

Many students who come to the University of Waterloo reject communications courses, not realizing
that communication is one of the most important life skills (including in software and computer science).

In spite of this, I have noticed many such students have ended up with improved communication skills from another
facet of the university education: the computer science curriculum itself (and not solely the communications classes).

As mathematics is simpler than other subjects (governed by simpler rules, etc.), we know more about it than say, social sciences, which are extremely complex.
This means that in education, math is a more difficult subject generally, as knowing more means there is more to teach. 

Because of this large amount of content to digest, mathematical explanations have a prerequisite of being clearer,
more concise, and more logical than other forms of communication. Adhering to this in other forms of communication as well improves the quality of communication.

This is how I write documentation for software as well, and encourage others to do the same. I even explain personal beliefs, opinions, and ideas this way.

To sum this up, I will answer the elephant in the room: what does a mathematical explanation look like?
    1. Motivation (why is this important? why care?)
    2. Theorems, strategies, ideation (what ideas/strategies are we using or assuming?)
    3. Challenges, solutions (what difficulties are there? How can we overcome them?)
    4. Conclusion (what are the benefits and negatives? What are the tradeoffs?)

A better idea of this can be given by reading math, but the idea is that the "mathematical" part of the explanation isn't the math, it's the structure itself. It's step-by-step, it's rational, it needs to get the viewer to understand its complex subject matter. All wrapped in a layer of conciseness and clarity. If something can be explained adhering to the same 
prerequisites mathematical communication has, it can probably stand the test of being understood by others.
